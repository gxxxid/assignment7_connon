__Project completes the following tasks:__

    1. Implement various types of projectiles.
    
    2. Develop several target types with different movement patterns.
    
    3.Transform the cannon into a moving tank.
    
    4.Create "bombs" that will be dropped by targets onto the cannon.
    
    5.Implement multiple cannons that can shoot at each other.


__Changes made to the program__

     def move(self, inc_x, inc_y): 
        -added the ability to move the target left and rigth, the previous abilities of the gun were only up and down. 
        -made sure that the variables changing the left/right and up/down had valuable variable names (inc_x, inc_y)
